Now a major motion picture from Sony Classics starring Glenn Close.

One of bestselling author Meg Wolitzer's most beloved books--an "acerbically funny" (Entertainment Weekly) and "intelligent...portrait of deception" (The New York Times).

The Wife is the story of the long and stormy marriage between a world-famous novelist, Joe Castleman, and his wife Joan, and the secret they've kept for decades. The novel opens just as Joe is about to receive a prestigious international award, The Helsinki Prize, to honor his career as one of America's preeminent novelists. Joan, who has spent forty years subjugating her own literary talents to fan the flames of his career, finally decides to stop.

Important and ambitious, The Wife is a sharp-eyed and compulsively readable story about a woman forced to confront the sacrifices she's made in order to achieve the life she thought she wanted. "A rollicking, perfectly pitched triumph...Wolitzer's talent for comedy of manners reaches a heady high" (Los Angeles Times), in this wise and candid look at the choices all men and women make--in marriage, work, and life.
